New magic wand

Description
In this phase, we'll continue to add magic by introducing the first gameplay features.

You'll develop the interaction between a user and the creatures: when a user clicks on two beings, they should swap places, match, and then disappear. Though we know you're an experienced spellcaster, you might still find events and their handlers useful for achieving this.

Objectives
Here are the steps to implement the gameplay scenario:

After you draw the map and creatures, a cursor should highlight this frame when it crosses a creature. Place it as the cell element's background;

Upon clicking a creature, its frame should change to this to indicate it's ready to swap places with its neighbors. Only creatures from cells above, below, right, or left are considered neighbors; diagonal creatures cannot participate in swapping;

When you click a neighboring creature, the two selected creatures swap. If this swap results in at least one sequence of three identical creatures, it's a success; proceed to the next step. If not, return the creatures back to their original places;

Look at how we handle sequences of identical creatures: clear the cells where the identical creatures are (more details in the example). When clearing the cells, make sure you do not remove the cell or set it to null . Instead, set its value to an empty string ("").

After resolving the sequence, continue the game from step 2: select creatures -> swap them -> remove the creatures from the sequence.
