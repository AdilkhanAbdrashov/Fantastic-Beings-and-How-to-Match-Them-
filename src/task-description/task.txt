The magic map

Description
Adding 25 cells to the HTML file was rather boring, wasn't it? In this stage, we will do a little magic trick: let's automate the creation of map cells with a JS script and make our game more flexible and universal by adding a configuration object.

Objectives
Make sure you've removed all table tag contents from your page; your HTML file will look something like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Fantastic Beings</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
<div id="board">
    <div id="status-bar"></div>
    <table id="map"></table>
</div>
</body>
</html>

Add a JS script to your page. It doesn't matter how you'll do it, but keep in mind that the amount of JS code will grow further on, so it makes sense to create a separate file for it.
Implement a function with name window.renderMap that dynamically fills the table tag with the passed number of rows and columns. Each created cell, as in the previous stage, should have the cell class. The function must take 2 input parameters: rowsCount and colsCount with which you can set the dimensions of the map. An example of calling this function:
window.renderMap = function(rowsCount, colsCount) {
    // Your code
}

// Call this function
window.renderMap(rowsCount, colsCount);

Once the HTML page is loaded, you need to call this method to draw the game field.
Also, create a function to clear the game field. You can achieve this using methods like setting innerHTML to an empty string (innerHTML = "") or other DOM manipulation techniques you find suitable:
window.clearMap = function() {
    // Your code
}

window.clearMap();

To make sure your method window.renderMap is flexible and versatile, try experimenting with different values for the map dimensions but leave 5x5 as the final size.
